I'm using json-server low version (it's 0.13.0, current is 0.17.0).
Because the latest version has some bug when we trying to send many unsynchronized request to the server.

So,

The json-server with specific version (0.13.0) has been declared in package.json and installed in node_modules.

Please run cmd as: ".\node_modules\.bin\json-server --watch data.json" to run json-server.
